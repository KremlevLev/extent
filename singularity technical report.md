# Singularity Technical Report and Experiment Ledger

**Working title:** *Singularity: Compute-Efficient Transplantation of Qwen3-14B into a Mamba-3/MLA Hybrid*

**Status:** research prototype; no quality or inference claims are established yet.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-17

This document is the source of truth for the paper. Every number must be marked as one of:

- **MEASURED:** produced by a recorded experiment;
- **DERIVED:** exactly computed from a configuration or measured values;
- **TARGET:** an acceptance criterion, not a result;
- **HYPOTHESIS:** a claim still requiring an experiment.

## 1. Research objective

Convert a pretrained Qwen3-14B Transformer into a deployable hybrid language model without full pretraining:

- preserve the Qwen embeddings, MLPs, normalization layers, and as much learned behavior as possible;
- replace approximately 85% of GQA sequence mixers with Mamba-3 MIMO blocks;
- convert the retained approximately 15% GQA layers into MLA;
- recover from the architecture-conversion “shock” using a severely constrained distillation/adaptation budget;
- preserve or extend useful long-context behavior;
- demonstrate an actual quality/latency/memory Pareto improvement with matched implementations and hardware.

The paper is not about merely combining Mamba and attention. The intended contribution is a **compute-efficient, MIMO-aware cross-architecture transplantation and recovery method**, evaluated jointly with GQA-to-MLA conversion.

## 2. Precise source model and target architecture

### 2.1 Source checkpoint

The source checkpoint is **Qwen/Qwen3-14B** (the released post-trained thinking/non-thinking model, not the separate `Qwen3-14B-Base` repository):

| Field | Value |
|---|---:|
| Layers | 40 |
| Hidden size | 5120 |
| MLP intermediate size | 17408 |
| Query heads | 40 |
| KV heads | 8 |
| Head dimension | 128 |
| Attention Q/K normalization | per-head RMSNorm |
| Vocabulary | 151936 |
| RoPE theta | 1,000,000 |
| Published maximum positions | 40960 |

The immutable source revision is `40c069824f4251a91eefaf281ebe4c544efd3e18`. Architecture recovery targets this exact checkpoint; any later additional reasoning tuning remains a separate stage.

### 2.2 Target ratio

The scientific target is exactly 15% MLA attention and 85% Mamba-3 MIMO. With 40 layers:

- 6 MLA layers = 15%;
- 34 Mamba-3 layers = 85%.

The production configuration uses six uniformly interleaved MLA layers at zero-based indices `[5, 12, 19, 25, 32, 39]`. Earlier 48-layer configurations were based on the wrong Qwen generation and are void for scientific claims.

The main retained-layer schedule is fixed to the uniform indices above. Alternative layer placements, if tested, are small-scale allocation ablations and do not restore the removed 25% architecture.

### 2.3 Long context

The production configuration now matches Qwen3 at `max_position_embeddings=40960`; tiny tests use shorter bring-up lengths. This field alone does not establish long-context support. Long-context claims require:

- a defined target (32K, 64K, or 128K);
- an MLA positional strategy compatible with the source checkpoint;
- training examples at sufficient lengths or a justified extrapolation method;
- RULER/retrieval/state-tracking evaluation across increasing lengths;
- peak-memory and latency measurements at the same lengths.

## 3. Candidate scientific contributions

### C1. MIMO-aware attention-to-Mamba-3 transplant

Develop a principled mapping from pretrained GQA projections into the Mamba-3 MIMO parameterization, including the MIMO channels, complex/data-dependent rotation components, exponential-trapezoidal recurrence, decay/time-step parameters, and output projection.

The contribution is valid only if it beats both random initialization and the strongest direct port of prior attention-to-Mamba initialization under the same token and compute budget.

### C2. Joint conversion shock and compute-efficient recovery

Measure and reduce the compounded damage caused by:

1. replacing most GQA mixers with Mamba-3 MIMO; and
2. converting the retained GQA mixers to MLA.

Compare simultaneous conversion with staged alternatives. A publishable result would show that a proposed initialization/recovery schedule reaches a fixed quality threshold with materially fewer tokens or accelerator-hours.

### C3. Quality-efficiency Pareto at approximately 15% attention

Show how attention retention, MLA latent rank, Mamba state size, and MIMO rank trade quality against:

- prefill time;
- decode time per token / tokens per second;
- KV-cache bytes per generated token;
- recurrent-state bytes per sequence;
- peak HBM;
- long-context retrieval and state tracking.

No inference speed claim is valid with the current reference `lax.scan` implementation. End-to-end speed requires optimized TPU kernels (likely Pallas) and a matched JAX baseline.

## 4. Required controlled ablations

Each ablation changes one factor, uses identical data order, optimizer budget, evaluation code, and as many seeds as affordable. Small-scale experiments establish causality before the 14B confirmation run.

### 4.1 Initialization/transplant ablation

| ID | Preserved Qwen components | New mixer initialization | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| INIT-A | embeddings, MLPs, norms | random Mamba-3/MLA | lower baseline |
| INIT-B | embeddings, MLPs, norms, output projections where compatible | otherwise random | projection-only baseline |
| INIT-C | same | strongest Mamba-in-the-Llama-style Q/K/V/O reuse port | prior-method baseline |
| INIT-D | same | proposed Mamba-3 SISO transplant | isolate Mamba-3 mapping |
| INIT-E | same | proposed Mamba-3 MIMO-aware transplant | main method |
| INIT-F | same | INIT-E without complex/rotation initialization | complex-state ablation |
| INIT-G | same | INIT-E with copied rather than decomposed MIMO channels | MIMO allocation ablation |

Primary immediate-shock metrics: validation NLL/perplexity before recovery, KL to teacher, layer-output normalized MSE, hidden-state cosine similarity, and logit agreement.

Primary recovery metrics: tokens and TPU-hours needed to recover 90%, 95%, and 99% of the teacher-to-shocked-student quality gap.

### 4.2 Joint conversion ablation

| ID | Replaced layers | Retained attention | Conversion schedule |
|---|---|---|---|
| JOINT-A | none | original GQA | teacher/control |
| JOINT-B | none | MLA | GQA-to-MLA only |
| JOINT-C | Mamba-3 | original GQA | Mamba conversion only |
| JOINT-D | Mamba-3 | MLA | simultaneous conversion |
| JOINT-E | Mamba-3 | MLA | Mamba recovery, then MLA conversion |
| JOINT-F | Mamba-3 | MLA | MLA recovery, then Mamba conversion |

This table is essential: without it, quality loss cannot be attributed to the Mamba transplant, MLA conversion, or their interaction.

### 4.3 Architecture/efficiency ablation

- The full-scale architecture is fixed at exactly 15% attention (6/40); no 25% model is retained as a baseline.
- Retained-layer allocation: uniform, late-layer biased, and sensitivity-ranked.
- Mamba-3: SISO vs MIMO; MIMO rank; state sizes 32/64/128; real vs complex; Euler vs trapezoidal where implementation permits.
- MLA: latent KV rank, query rank, partial-RoPE dimensions, and SVD/transplant method.
- Recovery: frozen vs trainable MLPs; mixer-only vs progressive unfreezing; hard-label CE vs teacher KL vs hidden-state matching; staged vs joint recovery.

### 4.4 Minimum credible scaling strategy

Run broad ablations at a smaller Qwen3 scale using the same conversion code, then promote only the best few variants to 14B. A single 14B run cannot establish causality. The 14B experiment should confirm the trend and demonstrate feasibility, not carry the entire ablation matrix.

## 5. Evaluation protocol

### 5.1 Quality and recovery

- Held-out language-model NLL/perplexity on a frozen, contamination-aware corpus slice.
- Teacher-student KL and top-k logit agreement.
- General tasks using a pinned lm-evaluation-harness revision and exact prompts.
- Reasoning/code evaluations only after base capability recovery.
- Report mean and spread over seeds for small-scale causal experiments.

### 5.2 Long context

- RULER and needle/retrieval tests at geometrically increasing lengths.
- State-tracking tasks relevant to Mamba-3's claimed advantage.
- Quality plotted against context length, not a single maximum-context score.
- Separate trained-length performance from extrapolation.

### 5.3 Inference

Compare against the unchanged Qwen3-14B GQA teacher and useful intermediate baselines on the same TPU slice, JAX version, BF16 precision, batch sizes, prompt lengths, generated lengths, compilation state, and sampling settings.

Record:

- time to first token (TTFT);
- inter-token latency (TPOT) and tokens/s;
- prefill latency;
- peak HBM;
- KV/recurrent cache bytes per sequence and per token;
- compilation time separately from steady-state runtime;
- batch-size and context-length sweeps.

The 15% MLA hybrid still has quadratic attention prefill in retained layers. Claims must describe the measured end-to-end behavior, not only asymptotic Mamba complexity.

### 5.4 Provisional success gates (targets, not results)

- **TARGET:** proposed MIMO-aware transplant materially reduces immediate conversion shock against INIT-C and INIT-A.
- **TARGET:** at least 2x fewer recovery tokens or TPU-hours to reach a fixed quality threshold than random initialization.
- **TARGET:** recovered model retains a defensible fraction of teacher quality across both perplexity and downstream tasks, with no benchmark cherry-picking.
- **TARGET:** optimized hybrid establishes a Pareto improvement in measured long-context decode memory/latency, not merely an analytical cache reduction.
- **TARGET:** key causal effects reproduce at small scale and are confirmed by selected 14B runs.

Thresholds will be frozen before final experiments after pilot variance is known.

## 6. Experiment ledger

### EXP-000 — Local reference and unit tests

- **Date reported:** 2026-08-17
- **Hardware:** local CPU for final development run; earlier 2x NVIDIA T4 diagnostics
- **Commit:** `896b292`
- **Result (MEASURED):** 9 local tests passed after adding the full-model Lion optimizer HBM probe.
- **T4 diagnostic (MEASURED):** sharded BF16 backward produced non-finite gradients in several MLP/output leaves; forcing FP32 compute produced finite gradients (`loss=4.8757`, `grad_norm=4.8774`, `max_abs_grad=0.6868`).
- **Interpretation:** old T4 BF16 behavior is treated as an engineering-platform limitation, not a model-quality result. TPU BF16 is the target path.

### EXP-001 — Tiny hybrid BF16 train step on TPU v5e-1

- **Hardware:** 1x TPU v5e device
- **Model:** 128,784-parameter tiny configuration
- **Result (MEASURED):** 7 tests passed in 31.94 s.
- **Sequence length 8, one step (MEASURED):** `loss=4.8756`, `grad_norm=4.8684`, `max_abs_grad=0.6875`, `grads_finite=True`.
- **Sequence length 128, three steps (MEASURED):** losses `4.8529, 4.8529, 4.8324`; gradient norms approximately `1.103`; no non-finite gradient leaves.
- **Interpretation:** BF16 forward/backward and Lion update are numerically viable on TPU for the tiny reference model. This does not test multi-device partitioning.

### EXP-002 — Tiny distributed BF16 train step on TPU v5e-8

- **Hardware:** one TPU v5e-8 slice; 8 devices visible
- **Mesh:** `data=1, fsdp=4, tensor=2`
- **Model:** 128,784 parameters
- **Result (MEASURED):** `partitioned_param_arrays=20/47`; `partitioned_train_state_arrays=40/97`.
- **Step 0 (MEASURED):** `loss=4.8750`, `grad_norm=4.8699`, `max_abs_grad=0.6875`, `grads_finite=True`, `nonfinite_grad_leaves=0`.
- **Interpretation:** the intended 8-device mesh, BF16 path, parameter sharding, Lion-state sharding, forward pass, backward pass, and update execute together on the tiny model.

### EXP-003 — VOID: wrong-generation bring-up shape audit and parameter allocation

- **Hardware:** one TPU v5e-8 slice for allocation; shape audit is hardware-independent
- **Configuration:** superseded 12 MLA / 36 Mamba bring-up prototype; removed from active configs and not used as a paper baseline
- **Commit:** `7c7b725`
- **Exact parameter count (DERIVED):** 14,655,260,384 across 723 tensors.
- **Partitioned tensors (DERIVED):** 278/723.
- **Global BF16 weight size (DERIVED):** 27.298 GiB.
- **Ideal per-device BF16 weights (DERIVED):** 3.418 GiB.

- **Real parameter allocation (MEASURED):** 3.418 GiB on each of TPU_0 through TPU_7.
- **Result (MEASURED):** full parameter initialization passed; optimizer and train step were not created.
- **Interpretation:** the 1x4x2 sharding mechanism worked, but the model used wrong-generation dimensions. No architecture or memory number from this experiment is valid for the Qwen3 target.

### EXP-004 — VOID: wrong-generation Lion persistent-state HBM probe

- **Commit:** `896b292`
- **Hardware:** one TPU v5e-8 slice
- **Mesh:** `data=1, fsdp=4, tensor=2`
- **Status:** VOID for the Qwen3 target; mechanical optimizer-sharding evidence only.
- **Command:** `full_preflight(["--initialize-optimizer"])` in the notebook process.
- **Parameter allocation (MEASURED):** 3.418 GiB on each of eight devices.
- **Lion optimizer allocation (MEASURED):** 3.418 GiB on each of eight devices.
- **Combined persistent allocation (MEASURED):** 6.835 GiB on each of eight devices.
- **Nominal remaining HBM (DERIVED):** 9.165 GiB/device relative to 16 GiB, before gradients, activations, XLA temporaries, executable buffers, and runtime overhead.
- **Result (MEASURED):** `optimizer_initialization=PASS`; no gradients, activations, or train step were created.
- **Interpretation:** the optimizer-sharding mechanism worked, but the model used wrong-generation dimensions. This is not a Qwen3 memory result.

### EXP-005 — VOID: wrong-generation 7/41 target shape audit

- **Hardware:** local shape-only trace; no full arrays allocated
- **Configuration:** obsolete 48-layer Qwen2.5-shaped prototype, not Qwen3-14B

- **Ideal training-state headroom at 16 GiB (DERIVED):** 5.715 GiB/device before activations and XLA/runtime overhead.
- **Result (DERIVED):** shape-only preflight passed.
- **Status:** VOID for research use. Retained only as an engineering-error log.

- **Share of final target parameters directly preserved (DERIVED):** 79.94%.
- **Direct scope:** token embeddings, lm_head, final norm, all input/post-attention norms, and all gate/up/down MLP projections.
- **Result (MEASURED):** pinned config/index validation and target-shape mapping validation passed.
- **Status:** VOID. The audit was internally correct but targeted the wrong model generation and must not be used in the paper.

### EXP-007 — Pinned Qwen3-14B metadata and direct-map audit

- **Implementation commit title:** `fix: migrate Singularity source and target to Qwen3-14B`
- **Source:** `Qwen/Qwen3-14B` (not `Qwen3-14B-Base`)

- **Independent reproduction (MEASURED):** the user reproduced the same metadata-only output in a separate runtime: 443 checkpoint tensors and 203 direct tensors / 12,251,714,560 parameters.

### EXP-008 — Qwen3 6/34 target shape audit

- **Configuration:** 6 MLA / 34 Mamba-3 MIMO, MLA indices `[5, 12, 19, 25, 32, 39]`
- **Exact parameter count (DERIVED):** 14,707,399,920 across 619 tensors.
- **Partitioned tensors (DERIVED):** 220/619.
- **Global BF16 weight size (DERIVED):** 27.395 GiB.

### EXP-009 — Exact JAX Qwen3 teacher parameter-tree contract

- **Implementation commit title:** `feat: add exact Qwen3 GQA teacher parity scaffold`
- **Mode:** local CPU structural tests plus metadata-only pinned checkpoint audit; no model shards downloaded
- **Teacher architecture:** 40-layer Qwen3 GQA with 40 query heads, 8 KV heads, head dimension 128, per-head Q/K RMSNorm, split-half RoPE, SwiGLU, and untied output head.
- **Checkpoint-to-teacher mapping (DERIVED/VALIDATED):** 443 of 443 source tensors mapped bijectively to 443 JAX parameter leaves; 14,768,307,200 parameters; 100% tensor coverage.
- **Tests (MEASURED):** 22 passed in 38.55 s, including BF16 parameter/logit shapes, split-half RoPE fixture, causal-independence test, and complete mapping bijection.
- **Result (MEASURED):** metadata preflight printed `teacher_mapping=PASS tensors=443 parameters=14,768,307,200 coverage=100%`.
- **Interpretation:** source names and shapes are fully accounted for. This is a prerequisite for parity, not evidence of numerical logits/NLL parity; cross-framework comparison after loading the pinned weights remains pending.

## 7. Development milestones

1. **Completed only for the sharding mechanism:** wrong-generation weights + Lion state fit on v5e-8; exact Qwen3 HBM validation remains pending.
2. **Completed:** set the Qwen3 target schedule to exactly 6/40 MLA layers.
3. **Completed:** validate the pinned Qwen3-14B metadata, target shapes, and streaming mapping contracts.
4. **Current:** implement the exact Qwen3 GQA teacher and establish logits/NLL parity before conversion.
5. Implement and test GQA-to-MLA conversion baselines.
6. Implement Mamba-3 transplant variants and single-layer shock tests.
7. Run small-scale ablations and freeze the 14B recovery recipe.
8. Compile the first guarded full-model short-sequence forward/backward.
9. Recovery training, fixed evaluation checkpoints, and failure logging.
10. Optimized inference kernel and matched end-to-end benchmarks.
11. Only after base recovery: separate reasoning SFT study using legally and scientifically documented data.

## 8. Reasoning SFT boundary

“Claude-like reasoning” is not part of the architecture-recovery claim. It should be a later experiment with explicit data provenance, permissions, filtering, and a frozen pre-SFT checkpoint. Otherwise architecture recovery and behavior imitation become confounded. Prefer reproducible/open reasoning datasets or lawfully generated teacher traces, and evaluate reasoning improvements separately from retained base capabilities.

## 10. Rules for future entries

For every experiment record:

- experiment ID, date, commit hash, config hash, checkpoint revision;
- hardware topology and software versions;
- dataset identity/revision, token count, sequence-length distribution, and seed;
- trainable/frozen parameter groups;
- optimizer, learning-rate schedule, batch size, accumulation, precision, and wall time;
- raw metrics and failure traces;
- interpretation separated from observation;
- artifact/checkpoint location and whether it is reproducible.

Failed experiments stay in the ledger. They are evidence for engineering decisions and prevent accidental repetition.
